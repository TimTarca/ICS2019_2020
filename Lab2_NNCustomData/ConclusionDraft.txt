	To collect the data, go to the website Zillow and randomly select houses to be a part of the database. 
Organize the data by csv format. With numbers equal to or greater than 1,000, do not separate numbers with commas.
	When doing a grid search, lower and higher than four hidden layers and four nodes showed to have 28% for 
the training set and 16% for the testing set. When running the neural network with four hidden layers and four nodes, 
the best results for the training set was 26%. For the testing set, the best results was 28%.  
	With the information from the results, the neural network was not able to accurately determine the location of a house. 
The near one-in-four chance shows that the data between houses was too similar. The result may also suggest that the
neural network was guessing the location of a house. If further research was done on this dataset, more attributes 
should be acquired to help the neural network more accurately
