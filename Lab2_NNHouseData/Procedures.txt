To setup the environment, install Python version 3.7.1. Also, have the following libraries: numpy 1.15.4, pandas 0.23.4, scikit-learn 0.20.1, and seaborn 0.9.0. From sklearn.utils, import shuffle; from sklearn.neural_network, import MLPClassifier; from sklearn.model_selection, import cross_validate; from sklearn.preprocessing, import normalize. 
	To collect the data, go to the website Zillow. Then randomly select twenty-five houses from each of the following areas: Orange County, CA; Dallas County, TX; Madison County, AL; Brooklyn, NY. Do not select houses without information about the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the pricing, and the square footage. 
  To normalize the data, use the normalize function. 
	The parameters of the neural network are the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the pricing, and the square footage. For the training set, give the neural network seventy-five data points. For the testing set, give the neural network twenty-five data points
